## Mission statement
Give all kids everywhere the opportunity to learn computer programming skills in a fun and safe environment.  Inspire them with a vision of what can be achieved.  Empower them with the state of the art skills they need to succeed.  Provide them the opportunity to engage their creativity by using computers to express themselves, make fun games, solve problems and do cool things.  Foster positive relationships through collaborative student teams that span across the country and around the globe.

TeachTheWorldToCode.org is a 501c(3) non-profit corporation formed with the mission to teach basic computer science skills to children throughout the United States and around the world.  We offer fee-based programs as well as need-based scholarships making it possible for all children to acquire skills that will help them thrive in the new world economy.

Additionally we raise funds through public grants and private donations to provide outreach to students around the world.
